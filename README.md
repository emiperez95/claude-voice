# üîä Claude Voice Notifier

Standalone audio notifications for Claude Code using macOS text-to-speech. Get voice alerts when Claude stops executing or needs your attention.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Stop Notifications**: Announces when Claude has finished executing
- **Attention Alerts**: Notifies when Claude needs user input
- **Tmux Integration**: Announces session number when running in tmux
- **Pure Bash**: No Python or external dependencies for the notifier
- **Lightweight**: Simple bash scripts using macOS built-in `say` command

## üìã Requirements

- **macOS** (uses the built-in `say` command)
- **jq** (for automated installation) - Install with: `brew install jq`
- **Optional**: tmux for session identification

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-voice.git
cd claude-voice
```

2. Run the automated installation:
```bash
./install.sh
```

The installer will automatically configure your `.claude/settings.local.json` with the necessary hooks.

### Testing

Test that voice notifications are working:
```bash
./test_voice.sh
```

You should hear:
- "Claude has stopped" (or with session number if in tmux)
- "Claude needs your attention"

### Uninstallation

To remove voice notifications:
```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

This will remove the hooks from your Claude settings while preserving all other configurations.

## üîß Installation Options

### Automated Installation (Requires jq)

The automated installer requires `jq` for JSON manipulation. If you don't have jq installed:
```bash
brew install jq
```

Then run the installer:
```bash
./install.sh              # Interactive installation
./install.sh --dry-run    # Preview changes without applying
./install.sh --force      # Overwrite existing hooks without prompting
./install.sh --help       # Show all available options
```

### Manual Installation (No jq required)

If you don't want to install jq, you can manually edit your `~/.claude/settings.local.json` file:

1. Open or create `~/.claude/settings.local.json`
2. Add or merge the following hooks:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "stop": {
      "command": "bash /absolute/path/to/claude-voice/voice_notifier.sh stop"
    },
    "notification": {
      "command": "bash /absolute/path/to/claude-voice/voice_notifier.sh notification"
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Replace `/absolute/path/to/claude-voice/` with the actual full path to your claude-voice directory.

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ voice_notifier.sh   # Main notification script (pure bash)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ install.sh          # Automated installation script (requires jq)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uninstall.sh        # Automated uninstallation script (requires jq)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_voice.sh       # Test script

```

## üéØ How It Works

1. Claude Code triggers hooks on specific events (stop, notification)
2. The hook passes event data to `voice_notifier.sh` via stdin
3. The bash script uses macOS `say` command to speak the notification
4. If running in tmux, it includes the session number for context

## üîä Customization

To modify the voice messages, edit the `handle_stop()` and `handle_notification()` functions in `voice_notifier.sh`:

```bash
# Current messages in the script:
speak "Claude has stopped in session $session_index"
speak "Claude needs your attention in session $session_index"
```

## ü§ù Integration with agent-workflow

This is a standalone extraction from the [agent-workflow](https://github.com/yourusername/agent-workflow) project. If you have agent-workflow installed, voice notifications are already included. This standalone version allows you to use voice notifications without the full workflow system.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### No sound heard
- Check system volume is turned up
- Test the `say` command directly: `say "test"`
- Ensure you're on macOS (Linux/Windows not supported)

### Script not found errors
- Use absolute paths in your settings.local.json
- Ensure the script has execute permissions: `chmod +x voice_notifier.sh`

### Tmux session not detected
- Ensure you're running inside a tmux session
- Check tmux is installed: `tmux -V`
